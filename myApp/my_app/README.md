# Recipe Recommender App
Coming up with meal ideas can be a challenging task, especially when trying to cater to children's preferences.<br>
Parents face the daily dilemma of selecting recipes that will appeal to their children while also considering the nutritional value of the meals.<br>
Additionally, there is the issue of forgetting to purchase necessary ingredients, which can pose a problem when preparing a meal within a limited timeframe.<br>
Many individuals rely on cooking recipes found on websites or in magazines; however, sometimes the listed ingredients are not readily available. <br>
Many households waste money on unused ingredients due to a lack of recipe knowledge or preference for certain foods. <br>
This leads to financial and nutritional drawbacks, as well as increased food waste. <br>
Our app aims to solve these issues by minimizing food waste and enhancing our users' culinary experiences. <br>
Through a *"virtual kitchen"* that mirrors the ingredients in their real kitchen, the app will help users try new recipes using the ingredients they already have.<br>
A click is all that is needed to generate hundreds of recipes tailored for the user.<br>
Further customization filters can be applied to find the perfect recipe.
