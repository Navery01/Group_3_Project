# Recipe Recommender App
Coming up with meal ideas can be a challenging task, especially when trying to cater to children's preferences.<br>
Parents face the daily dilemma of selecting recipes that will appeal to their children while also considering the nutritional value of the meals.<br>
Additionally, there is the issue of forgetting to purchase necessary ingredients, which can pose a problem when preparing a meal within a limited timeframe.<br>
Many individuals rely on cooking recipes found on websites or in magazines; however, sometimes the listed ingredients are not readily available. <br>
Many households waste money on unused ingredients due to a lack of recipe knowledge or preference for certain foods. <br>
This leads to financial and nutritional drawbacks, as well as increased food waste. <br>
Our app aims to solve these issues by minimizing food waste and enhancing our users' culinary experiences. <br>
Through a *"virtual kitchen"* that mirrors the ingredients in their real kitchen, the app will help users try new recipes using the ingredients they already have.<br>
A click is all that is needed to generate hundreds of recipes tailored for the user.<br>
Further customization filters can be applied to find the perfect recipe. 

# **Milestone Code 1** <br>
At this stage, we have setup a webpage for the the App with general funtionalities such Admin login and update.<br>
We have also included Add recipes function, which will allow the application to store available recipes for processing.<br> 

# **Milestone Code 2** <br>
After runing the unit and system test for the intial stage,<br>
We have added an ingredient database and a recipe database.
We have added two pages to the website. We have the home page where there is a list of ingredients and their expiring dates.<br> 
You can add ingredients and also delete any ingredient that you don't want in your final list.<br>
We have the recipe list in the second page. 


# **RELEASE NOTES (July 07, 2023)** <br>
# **Milestone Code 3** <br>
We have added further improvements to the ingredients list and integrated functionality to the recipes list.
The app discretely reads the local recipe json file. When you move to the recipes list, the recipe database will be read automatically.
Based on the currently available ingredients, appropriate recipes will be generated in list form. 
Filters have been integrated so further specify the type of recipes desired, based on cuisine type or ingredients.
Real-world testing is in progress. Correction of bugs and UX improvements are ongoing.


# **Milestone Code 4** <br>
We hve further improved on our app performance to be more user friendly and fit in any platform and variuos devices.
We have added color to indicate the status of each ingredient. Apart from expiring date under each ingredient, green, yellow and red color have been added to show the status. Green means the good, yellow means about to expire while red means expired.
Both automated and manual testing had been carried out to find and fix all the discovered bugs

Real-world testing is in progress. Correction of bugs and UX improvements are ongoing.
